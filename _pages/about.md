Hello, my name is Sarah. I am a senior at Caltech majoring in Computer Science, with minors in Mathematics and Information + Data Science. I have worked with Dr. Ricardo Baptista, Profs. Adam Wierman, Steven Low and Anima Anandkumar at Caltech.

My research interests lie in using computational mathematics to create more structured and physically grounded systems by integrating physical principles, particularly for solving complex engineering problems. I am especially interested in improving experimental design through the application of statistics, optimization, and mathematical analysis. For instance, I have developed scalable probabilistic modeling algorithms for Markov Random Fields using computational measure transport. More recently, I have been exploring the intersection of statistical physics and machine learning, particularly by analyzing the learning process as a dynamical system.

I am always eager to discuss ideas, and welcome any comments/questions about my research interests.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
